# Ant Colony Optimisation
Modeled and simulated ant colony optimization, where a large number of ants start from nest, in equal number towards each food source. The food sources are located at varied distances from the nest. With iterations, the path chosen by ants is revised based on the algorithm of ant colony optimisation. Ultimately, all ants end up going to the food source that is closest to the ant nest.
